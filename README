                           ### README for Boef ###                              

Boef (Buffer Overflow Exploitation Framework) is, as the name would imply, a 
buffer overflow exploitation framework.

## Compiling ##
To build Boef, run:

    ./configure
    make

To install Boef (by default to /usr/local/bin):

    make install

## Reporting Bugs ##
To report a bug, gather as much information about the bug as possible, 
including:
    The conditions required to replicate the bug
    The system on which the bug occurred (uname -a)
    Any relevant stack traces / core dumps

Then either:
    Email the author (quetuo@quetuo.net) with your bug report
    Email the Boef mailing list (boef-developer@lists.sourceforge.net)

## Versioning ##
Boef is working towards a version 1.0 in which all the project's aims are 
implemented.  Each new major feature or milestone increments the minor version 
by one.  The initial version was 0.1, and development continues towards 1.0 
from there.  0.2 (the next version) will be reached when the framework can be 
used standalone to develop a fully working exploit for a simple test program.
